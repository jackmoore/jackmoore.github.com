### Wheelzoom doesn't change the DOM.  It works by sizing and positioning background-size and background-position styles.

Wheelzoom replaces an img's background-image with it's src.  Then the src is set to a transparent PNG.  The benefit to using a background-image is that plugin does not change the DOM or the positioning of the img element. This means that the plugin should Just Workâ„¢ regardless of your specific CSS or markup.  The drawback that there is no support for background-sizing in older browsers (IE8).  The img element is left unmodified for unsupported browsers.
